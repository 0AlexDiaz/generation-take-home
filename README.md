Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is a take-home coding challenge used to help evaluate candidates
interested in joining the team at Generation.
The goal is for candidates to complete the coding challenge before the
in-person interview so that we can discuss the solution together.
In cases where this is not possible, we may discuss the solution together
over a followup phone call.

### What should you expect?

We expect that the exercise will take anywhere from 2-5 hours to complete
depending on your familiarity with React and with the GoogleMaps API.

We understand that this is a significant amount of time so we really appreciate
the effort you put into it. 

### How should you submit your code?

Any way you want - send us a zip, a link to your personal repo, etc. 


### How do you start?

Clone the repo on your computer

Run
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
Read the intro and next steps on localhost:3000
Edit `src/YourComponent.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).
